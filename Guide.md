## Guide
**Hyundai AutoEver**, which respects the spirit of openness and sharing, has released open source guide documents for internal members so that anyone can use it. (However, some contents such as the website link of the company system are excluded.)

Using the open source when developing the software has become a must, not an option due to many benefits : shortening development periods and reducing costs. Have you ever wondered if you are using a lot of open source properly when developing in the company?

Organizations that use open source or contribute to the open source community have the necessary activities to protect their intellectual property and mitigate compliance risks. These activities are called open source compliance activities, and there are five essential elements to establish open source compliance.
### Organization 

   OSPO (Open Source Program Office) means a center organization that manages open source and reduce open source compliance risk in the company. It can play a role to build the overall open source strategy of the company such as auditing and constituting other policies on the use and distribution of open source, training for the software developers in the company, spreading an open source culture and activating participation in open source community.

### Policy

   After the organization has been configured, the next step is to establish a policy. Open source policy is necessary to protect intellectual property and mitigate compliance risk when organizations that distribute software use or contribute to open source. For efficient open source compliance activities, each company needs to establish the policy that matches the software type and business type. The following discloses how Hyundai Autoever has established an open source policy.

* 1. Purpose
** This policy was established to ensure that all organizations using open source conduct open source compliance activities. This policy also provides a way for employees to understand the value of open source and contribute to the open source community.
Hyundai AutoEver's employees contribute to the effectiveness of the policy and the level of compliance of the company by understanding the basis and content of this policy and faithfully performing the necessary activities.
*** It is important to comply with this policy. Non-compliance may result in the following:
**** - Legal claims by the holder of copyrights or other intellectual property rights for the code in use.
**** - Claims from customers
**** - Unintentional disclosure of company’s proprietary code
**** - Fines for breach of license obligations
**** - Loss of reputation/revenue
**** - Violation of contracts with suppliers and customers
*** For this reason, Hyundai AutoEver takes violations of this code seriously, and individuals who violate the code may be subject to disciplinary action by the company.
 
* 2. Application
** This open source policy applies to "all products provided or distributed externally by the company."
The internal use of open source is not within the scope of this policy.
Additionally, this policy applies when Hyundai AutoEver employees contribute to open source projects or disclose Hyundai AutoEver's code as open source.
