## Guide
**Hyundai AutoEver**, which respects the spirit of openness and sharing, has released open source guide documents for internal members so that anyone can use it. (However, some contents such as the website link of the company system are excluded.)

Using the open source when developing the software has become a must, not an option due to many benefits : shortening development periods and reducing costs. Have you ever wondered if you are using a lot of open source properly when developing in the company?

Organizations that use open source or contribute to the open source community have the necessary activities to protect their intellectual property and mitigate compliance risks. These activities are called open source compliance activities, and there are five essential elements to establish open source compliance.
### Organization 

   OSPO (Open Source Program Office) means a center organization that manages open source and reduce open source compliance risk in the company. It can play a role to build the overall open source strategy of the company such as auditing and constituting other policies on the use and distribution of open source, training for the software developers in the company, spreading an open source culture and activating participation in open source community.

### Policy

   After the organization has been configured, the next step is to establish a policy. Open source policy is necessary to protect intellectual property and mitigate compliance risk when organizations that distribute software use or contribute to open source. For efficient open source compliance activities, each company needs to establish the policy that matches the software type and business type. The following discloses how Hyundai Autoever has established an open source policy.

#### 1. Purpose

   This policy was established to ensure that all organizations using open source conduct open source compliance activities. This policy also provides a way for employees to understand the value of open source and contribute to the open source community.
Hyundai AutoEver's employees contribute to the effectiveness of the policy and the level of compliance of the company by understanding the basis and content of this policy and faithfully performing the necessary activities.
   It is important to comply with this policy. Non-compliance may result in the following:
    - Legal claims by the holder of copyrights or other intellectual property rights for the code in use.
    - Claims from customers
    - Unintentional disclosure of company’s proprietary code
    - Fines for breach of license obligations
    - Loss of reputation/revenue
    - Violation of contracts with suppliers and customers
   For this reason, Hyundai AutoEver takes violations of this code seriously, and individuals who violate the code may be subject to disciplinary action by the company.
 
#### 2. Application

   This open source policy applies to "all products provided or distributed externally by the company."
The internal use of open source is not within the scope of this policy.
Additionally, this policy applies when Hyundai AutoEver employees contribute to open source projects or disclose Hyundai AutoEver's code as open source.
You can find Hyundai AutoEver's open source policy through the Open Source Compliance.
 
#### 3. Terminology

   "Open Source" - Software covered by one or more licenses that meet the Open Source Definition published by the Open Source Initiative (OpenSource.org) or the Free Software Definition published by the Free Software Foundation, or similar licenses.

Evaluation records are to be maintained for a minimum of three years.
 
#### 6. Open Source Usage Policy

   In order to use open source, what an open source license is must first be identified, and the obligations required by the license must be reviewed and confirmed. As such, in the software to be supplied, open source and the respective license obligations are identified, and compliance activities according to the license obligations are conducted when distributing the software.
   In order to perform effectively, follow the Hyundai AutoEver open source compliance processes.
The Open Source Manager should consult with the Legal Team with any questions regarding the processes required for open source license compliance.
The results of the decision to use open source and the relevant evidence are to be recorded in the open source issue tracking system (Open Source Compliance).
 
#### 7. External Inquiry Response Policy

   Contact information is to be provided for external inquiries/requests related to open source for software distributed by Hyundai AutoEver. To this end, when distributing software, provide the email address of the Open Source Center, and register contact information with the Linux Foundation's Open Compliance Directory (https://compliance.linuxfoundation.org/references/open-compliance-directory).

   Anyone who receives an inquiry related to open source from an external source should contact the Open Source Manager. The Open Source Manager will process the inquiry and assign it to the appropriate person or organization within the company. The Open Source Manager has overall responsibility for assigning and handling inquiries.

   In case of non-compliance issues raised from an external source regarding software distributed by Hyundai AutoEver, the Open Source Manager will handle it as follows:

Hyundai AutoEver affirms that the open source programs, including Hyundai AutoEver's open source policy, are still carrying out activities to comply with all requirements of OpenChain Specification 2.0 18 months after confirming compliance with all requirements. 


### Process

   In order to use open source based on Hyundai AutoEver's open source policy, it is necessary to first identify what an open source license is, and review and confirm the obligations required by the license.

As such, it is necessary to identify the license obligations of the open source included in the software to be distributed, and conduct open source compliance activities to comply with the license obligations when distributing the software.

Hyundai AutoEver's open-source compliance processor defines a series of processes for managing open sources used in the software to be distributed. This process includes the following matters:

    1. Identify all open sources used in the software to be distributed.
    2. Identify and track all obligations arising from the identified open source.
    3. Activities to fulfill all obligations

In order to perform the above effectively, all software supply managers of Hyundai AutoEver will perform the following ten steps.

#### Step 1. Identification of Open Source

<img src="/assets/img/Step 1. Identification of Open Source.jpg" alt="1"></img><br/>

   The identification step of open source is a review step for identifying open source components. The open source included in the software to be distributed is monitored, regardless of whether it is AutoEver's proprietary software or a third-party software. The method for identifying an open source is as follows.

• Receive open source use request: A software developer informs the Open Source Manager or the Open Source Center that the software developer wants to use an open source for a specific product, and provides information on the use of an open source package for review and approval.

• Auditing company-developed software: Since developers can create software by copying and importing the source code of an open source, the company-developed software is also audited.

• Third-party software implementation (Due diligence)
```
Conditions for starting the identification step	
- Receive request from developers for specific open-source use
- Software auditing step in the development process
- Third-party software acquisition and integration into development software
```

```
Identification step results
- Create a compliance record for open source
- Source code scan target selection and request
```
#### Step 2. Auditing Source Code
<img src="/assets/img/Step 2. Auditing Source Code.jpg" alt="2"></img><br/>

In the source code auditing step, source code analysis tools are used to scan the source code to discover open sources. BlackDuck HUB and FOSSID are used as a source code scanning tools. If an open source is found to have an unusable open source license, whether due to policy reasons such as GPL-3.0 or incompatibility due to a licensing conflict, it is to be marked as an issue and a solution should be requested from the development team.

```
Conditions for starting the source code auditing step
- Source code scan request
```

```
Source code auditing step results
- Generate source code scan results (including information such as the origin of open source, licenses, etc.)
- Request for solution from the development team for the identified issues
```

#### Step 3. Resolving Issues
<img src="/assets/img/Step 3. Resolving Issues.jpg" alt="3"></img><br/>
Resolve all issues identified in the source code auditing step. Issues are assigned to the development team, and the Open Source Manager confirms whether that all issues are properly resolved.

```
Conditions for starting the step for resolving issues
- Complete source code scan and identify result-generating issues
```

```
Results of step for resolving issues
- Resolve all identified issues
```

#### Step 4. Reviews
<img src="/assets/img/Step 4. Reviews.jpg" alt="4"></img><br/>

Once all identified issues have been resolved, the review step follows. The procedure of the review step is as follows.

1. Software PL: Submit a request for the approval of use of open source included in the software.
2. Open Source Manager: Upon receipt of a request for approval of use of open source, confirm whether all information is included without omission and proceed with the review process.
3. Source code auditor: Confirm whether all issues are resolved by auditing source code.
4. Legal Team: Review licensing issues.

```
Conditions for starting the review step
- Resolve all identified issues
```

```
Review step results
- Ready for approval after review by the Open Source Manager, a source code auditor, the Legal Team, etc.
```

#### Step 5. Approval
<img src="/assets/img/Step 5. Approval.jpg" alt="5"></img><br/>

   The approval step follows once the review is completed. The OSRB either approves or rejects the use of open source. In case of rejection, an explanation of the reason and correction methods are suggested. Once the OSRB approves the use of the open source component, the development team begins preparing to fulfill the licensing obligations.

```
Conditions for starting the approval step
- Review completed
```
```
Approval step results
- OSRB approves or rejects the use of open source
- In case of refusal, an explanation of the reason and correction methods are suggested
```

#### Step 6. Registration

<img src="/assets/img/Step 6. Registration.jpg" alt='6'></img><br/>
   Open source components approved for use are added to a software inventory (BOM) that tracks the usage of open sources. The BOM contains information such as the name of an open source component, version, software manager's name, name of the product that uses it, product version, and product release number.
   
```
Conditions for starting the registration step
- OSRB approves use of open source
```
```
Registration step results
- Register open source components in the BOM
```


#### Step 7. Notice
<img src="/assets/img/Step 7. Notice.jpg" alt='7'></img><br/>

   One of the main duties when using open source is the duty of notice. To this end, the following matters are performed:
   
•	Provide copyright and license notices.
•	Provide a copy of the license.
•	Inform end users how to obtain copies of the source code (if applicable).

```
Conditions for starting the notice step
- Register open source in the BOM
```
```
Notice step results
- Prepare copyright and license notices and report them to relevant departments for inclusion in products
```
These matters are reported to the relevant departments so that they can be included at the product's distribution. If there is a screen on the product, a user can check the content of the open source notice in Menu > Open Source Notice Information. If there is no screen on the product, the contents of the open source notice are to be included in the user manual.

#### Step 8. Pre-Distributions Verifications
<img src="/assets/img/Step 8. Pre-Distributions Verifications.jpg" alt='8'></img><br/>

   In this step, checks are performed to ensure the following matters:
•	Collect the source code to be published as required by the open source license.
•	The collected source code should match the binary loaded in the product.
•	Remove inappropriate comments from the source code.
•	Appropriate notices are included with the product. Herein, a written offer for end users to receive the source code should also be provided.

```
Conditions for starting the pre-distribution verification step
- All open-source components are registered in the BOM
```
```
Pre-distribution verification step results
- Measures to fulfill the duty to notice
- Collect source code to be published
- Decide how to provide source code
- Complete pre-distribution verification
```

#### Step 9. Distribution
<img src="/assets/img/Step 9. Distribution.jpg" alt='9'></img><br/>
   When the pre-distribution verification is completed, the source code package to be published is uploaded to the open source distribution site. It is possible to register by product and version on the open source distribution site. End users can search and download the source code package corresponding to the version of the product they want from the open source distribution site.

```
Conditions for starting the distribution step 
- All pre-distribution verifications completed
```
```
Distribution step results
- Upload the source code package to be published for a specific product version to the open source distribution site
```

#### Step 10. Final Verifications
<img src="/assets/img/Step 10. Final Verifications.jpg" alt='10'></img><br/>
   After uploading the source code package to be published to the open-source distribution site, confirm whether the package has been uploaded correctly and whether it can be downloaded and decoded externally without errors. When building according to the license and guarantee of binary generation is requested, confirm whether the building the source code downloaded externally generates a binary without errors according to the instructions in the README, and whether the generated binary is the same as the binary loaded in the product.
 
 ```
 Conditions for starting the final verification step
 - The source code to be published is posted on an open source distribution site
 ```
 ```
 Final verification step results
 - Confirm whether the externally downloaded product performs without issues and whether it matches the binary of the same version as the product
  ```
