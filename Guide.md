Using the open source when developing the software has become a must, not an option due to many benefits : shortening development periods and reducing costs. Have you ever wondered if you are using a lot of open source properly when developing in the company?

Organizations that use open source or contribute to the open source community have the necessary activities to protect their intellectual property and mitigate compliance risks. These activities are called open source compliance activities, and there are five essential elements to establish open source compliance.
* Organization *

   OSPO (Open Source Program Office) means a center organization that manages open source and reduce open source compliance risk in the company. It can play a role to build the overall open source strategy of the company such as auditing and constituting other policies on the use and distribution of open source, training for the software developers in the company, spreading an open source culture and activating participation in open source community.

* Policy
After the organization has been configured, the next step is to establish a policy. Open source policy is necessary to protect intellectual property and mitigate compliance risk when organizations that distribute software use or contribute to open source. For efficient open source compliance activities, each company needs to establish the policy that matches the software type and business type. The following discloses how Hyundai Autoever has established an open source policy.
